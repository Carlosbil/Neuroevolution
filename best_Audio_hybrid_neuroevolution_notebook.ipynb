    "# Audio Hybrid Neuroevolution Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a hybrid neuroevolution process for audio classification (Parkinson detection). The system combines genetic algorithms with 1D convolutional neural networks to evolve optimal architectures for audio processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Features:\n",
    "- **Hybrid genetic algorithm**: Combines architecture and weight evolution\n",
    "- **1D Convolutional Networks**: Optimized for audio waveform processing\n",
    "- **Parallel 5-Fold Cross-Validation**: Each individual is evaluated on all 5 folds IN PARALLEL (fitness = average accuracy)\n",
    "- **Multi-threading**: Folds are trained simultaneously in separate threads for faster evaluation\n",
    "- **Adaptive mutation**: Dynamic mutation rate based on population diversity\n",
    "- **Audio dataset support**: Loads .npy files with train/val/test splits\n",
    "- **Intelligent stopping criteria**: By target fitness or maximum generations\n",
    "- **Complete visualization**: Shows progress and final best architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "1. Create initial population of 1D CNN architectures\n",
    "2. Evaluate fitness of each individual using **parallel 5-fold CV** (robust and faster with threading)\n",
    "3. Select best architectures (elitism)\n",
    "4. Apply crossover and mutation to create new generation\n",
    "5. Repeat process until convergence\n",
    "6. Display the best architecture found for Parkinson classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Performance**: Multi-threaded 5-fold CV provides robustness against overfitting while being much faster than sequential training.\n"

    "Este notebook está configurado para usar el **nuevo dataset** que combina:\n",
    "- 🎵 **Datos Reales**: Audios originales de pacientes  \n",
    "- 🤖 **Datos Sintéticos**: Audios generados por GANs (BigVSAN 40_1e5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ventajas de este dataset**:\n",
    "- Mayor diversidad de datos para entrenamiento\n",
    "- Combina la autenticidad de datos reales con la variedad de datos generados\n",
    "- Ideal para mejorar la generalización del modelo\n",
    "- Estratificación balanceada entre clases (control/patológico)\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 Parallel 5-Fold Cross-Validation durante la Evolución**: \n",
    "- **CADA** individuo se evalúa en **TODOS** los 5 folds **EN PARALELO**\n",
    "- Los 5 folds se entrenan **simultáneamente** en threads separados\n",
    "- El fitness es el **promedio** de accuracy de los 5 folds\n",
    "- ✅ **Mucho más rápido** que entrenamiento secuencial\n",
    "- ✅ **Más robusto** - evita sobreajuste a un fold específico\n",
    "\n",
    "**📊 Evaluación Final**: \n",
    "- Al terminar la evolución, la mejor arquitectura se vuelve a evaluar con 5-fold CV\n",
    "- Se reportan métricas completas (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1, AUC)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Importante: Parallel 5-Fold Cross-Validation durante la Evolución\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cambio clave**: Ahora cada individuo se evalúa con **5-fold cross-validation PARALELO** durante el proceso evolutivo:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Durante la evolución**:\n",
    "   - Cada individuo se entrena y evalúa en **cada uno de los 5 folds SIMULTÁNEAMENTE**\n",
    "   - Los 5 folds se ejecutan en **threads separados** (paralelización)\n",
    "   - El **fitness final** es el **promedio** de las accuracies de los 5 folds\n",
    "   - Se espera a que **todos los folds terminen** antes de calcular el fitness\n",
    "   - Esto garantiza que la arquitectura seleccionada no esté sobreajustada a un fold específico\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ventajas de la paralelización**:\n",
    "   - 🚀 **Mucho más rápido**: Los 5 folds se entrenan simultáneamente (en threads)\n",
    "   - ✅ **Más robusto**: La mejor arquitectura generaliza mejor\n",
    "   - ✅ **Menos sesgado**: No depende de un solo split de datos\n",
    "   - 💡 **Aprovecha multi-core**: Usa múltiples núcleos de CPU para acelerar\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Proceso paralelo**:\n",
    "   - Generación 0: Se crean N individuos aleatorios\n",
    "   - Para cada individuo:\n",
    "     - **Thread Pool**: Se crean 5 threads (uno por fold)\n",
    "     - **Fold 1-5**: Se entrenan y evalúan **SIMULTÁNEAMENTE** → accuracy₁...accuracy₅\n",
    "     - **Espera**: Se espera a que **todos los threads terminen**\n",
    "     - **Fitness** = (accuracy₁ + accuracy₂ + accuracy₃ + accuracy₄ + accuracy₅) / 5\n",
    "   - Se seleccionan los mejores según fitness promedio\n",
    "   - Se aplica crossover y mutación\n",
    "   - Siguiente generación...\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rendimiento**:\n",
    "   - Tiempo de evaluación ≈ tiempo del fold más lento (en lugar de suma de todos)\n",
    "   - Aceleración teórica: ~5x más rápido que secuencial\n",
    "   - Aceleración real: depende del número de cores disponibles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nota**: Para hacer pruebas rápidas, puedes reducir `population_size` y `max_generations` en la configuración."

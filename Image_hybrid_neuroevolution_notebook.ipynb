    "# Image Hybrid Neuroevolution Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a hybrid neuroevolution process for image classification (Parkinson detection from spectrograms). The system combines genetic algorithms with 2D convolutional neural networks to evolve optimal architectures for image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Features:\n",
    "- **Hybrid genetic algorithm**: Combines architecture and weight evolution\n",
    "- **2D Convolutional Networks**: Optimized for spectrogram image processing\n",
    "- **5-Fold Cross-Validation**: Each individual is evaluated on all 5 folds sequentially (fitness = average accuracy)\n",
    "- **CUDA-safe training**: Sequential fold training to avoid GPU memory conflicts\n",
    "- **Adaptive mutation**: Dynamic mutation rate based on population diversity\n",
    "- **Image dataset support**: Loads spectrogram images from PNG files\n",
    "- **Intelligent stopping criteria**: By target fitness or maximum generations\n",
    "- **Complete visualization**: Shows progress and final best architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "1. Create initial population of 2D CNN architectures\n",
    "2. Evaluate fitness of each individual using **5-fold CV** (robust evaluation)\n",
    "3. Select best architectures (elitism)\n",
    "4. Apply crossover and mutation to create new generation\n",
    "5. Repeat process until convergence\n",
    "6. Display the best architecture found for Parkinson classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Performance**: Sequential 5-fold CV provides robustness against overfitting and is CUDA-safe."

    "**Dataset configurado**: `images_all_real_syn_n` (Espectrogramas como Imágenes PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Este notebook está configurado para usar el **nuevo dataset de imágenes** generado con `npy_to_spectrograms.py`:\n",
    "- 🎵 **Espectrogramas como Imágenes**: Archivos PNG generados desde datos .npy  \n",
    "- 🖼️ **Formato**: Imágenes RGB de espectrogramas de audios\n",
    "- 📊 **5-Fold Cross-Validation**: Organizado en carpetas train/val/test por fold\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ventajas de este dataset**:\n",
    "- Mayor diversidad de datos para entrenamiento\n",
    "- Procesamiento mediante Conv2D (óptimo para imágenes)\n",
    "- Visualización directa de los espectrogramas\n",
    "- Estratificación balanceada entre clases (control/patológico)\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 5-Fold Cross-Validation durante la Evolución**: \n",
    "- **CADA** individuo se evalúa en **TODOS** los 5 folds **SECUENCIALMENTE**\n",
    "- Los folds se entrenan uno tras otro para evitar conflictos de CUDA\n",
    "- El fitness es el **promedio** de accuracy de los 5 folds\n",
    "- ✅ **CUDA-safe** - evita errores de memoria de GPU\n",
    "- ✅ **Más robusto** - evita sobreajuste a un fold específico\n",
    "\n",
    "**📊 Evaluación Final**: \n",
    "- Al terminar la evolución, la mejor arquitectura se vuelve a evaluar con 5-fold CV\n",
    "- Se reportan métricas completas (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1, AUC)\n",
